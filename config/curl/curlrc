# Maximum time in seconds that you allow curl's connection to take.
# This only limits the connection phase, so if curl connects within the
# given period it continues - if not it exits.
connect-timeout = 20

# Set maximum time in seconds that you allow each transfer to take.
# Prevents your batch jobs from hanging for hours due to slow networks or links
# going down. This option accepts decimal values.
#max-time = 900

# Use the specified proxy.
# The proxy string can be specified with a protocol:// prefix.
# No protocol specified or http:// it is treated as an HTTP proxy.
# Use socks4://, socks4a://, socks5:// or socks5h:// to request a specific SOCKS
# version to be used.
# Note: ssh -D 0.0.0.0:1337 -C -N user@host
#proxy = "socks5h://127.0.0.1:1337"

# (HTTP) Specify the User-Agent string to send to the HTTP server.
# To encode blanks in the string, surround the string with single quote marks.
# This header can also be set with the -H, --header or the --proxy-header options.
# Note: Firefox 123.0
#user-agent = "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:123.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/123.0"

# (HTTP) If the server reports that the requested page has moved to a different location
# (indicated with a Location: header and a 3XX response code), this option makes curl
# redo the request on the new place.
location

# (HTTP) Set maximum number of redirections to follow.
# When -L, --location is used, to prevent curl from following too many redirects,
# by default, the limit is set to 50 redirects. Set this option to -1 to make it unlimited.
# Note: 20 is the same as Firefox uses.
max-redirs = 20

# (HTTP) Set the referrer URL in the HTTP request.
# This can also be set with the -H, --header flag of course.
# When used with -L, --location you can append ";auto"" to the -e, --referer URL
# to make curl automatically set the previous URL when it follows a Location: header.
referer = ";auto"

# Make curl display transfer progress as a simple progress bar instead of the standard,
# more informational, meter.
# Note: simpler than the default progress bar
#progress-bar

# Use IPv4 addresses only when resolving hostnames, and not for example try IPv6.
#ipv4

# When used with -s, --silent, it makes curl show an error message if it fails.
#show-error
